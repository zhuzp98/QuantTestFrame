# QuantTestFrame

This is a practice for trading strategies. Focus on Cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin and Ethereum. 

Multiple indicators are included, with several optimized custom indicators based on classic ones. 

The main strategies are based on TradingView backtest platform and thus we mainly use Pine script.

In the future we will apply some lightweighted trading frames with C++, and potentially we may develop our own quant frame.
